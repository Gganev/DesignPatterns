# Introduction to design patterns
The main goal is to produce easily maintainable and extendable code. Be careful not to overuse patterns on simple problems, it is always possible to refactor code when a feature becomes more complex over time. Knowing when to implement a pattern over a functional approach and vice versa is key.

Inspired by this great youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHpsC5ng_E&list=PLF206E906175C7E07

## Strategy Pattern:
Useful when multiple classes implement the same method but each implementation differs. Especially if an implementation has to change/switch at runtime.
